# Low:
#  - Center points for fief allocation are calculated (villages 1 / castles 2 / towns 3)
#    instead of (villages 1 / castles 1 / towns 2).
#  - For qst_rescue_prisoner and qst_offer_gift, the relatives that can be a target of the
#    quest have been extended to include uncles and aunts and in-laws.
#  - Alterations to script_calculate_troop_score_for_center (these changes currently are
#    only relevant during claimant quests).
#  - When picking a new faction, lords are more likely to return to their original faction
#    (except when that's the faction they're being exiled from), if the ordinary conditions
#    for rejoining are met.  A lord's decision may also be influenced by his relations with
#    other lords in the various factions, instead of just his relations with the faction
#    leaders.
# Medium:
#  - Some changes for lord relation gains/losses when fiefs are allocated.
#  - Kings overrule lords slightly less frequently on faction issues.
#  - In deciding who to support for a fief, minor parameter changes for certain personalities.
#    Some lords will still give priority to fiefless lords or to the lord who conquered the
#    center if they have a slightly negative relation (normally the cutoff is 0 for all
#    personalities).
#  - When a lord can't find any good candidates for a fief under the normal rules,
#    instead of automatically supporting himself he uses a weighted scoring scheme.
#  - In various places where "average renown * 3/2" appears, an alternate calculation is
#    sometimes used.
# High:
#  - The "renown factor" when an NPC lord or the player courts and NPC lady is adjusted by
#    the prestige of the lady's guardian.

#
# Mercantilism
# - Your caravans generate more revenue for your towns, but your benefit
#   from the caravans of other kingdoms is diminished.
# - Trade within the kingdom is made more efficient, while imports are
#   discouraged.
#
# Low:
# - Caravan trade benefits both the source and the destination
# - When the player surrenders, there is a chance his personal equipment
#   will not be looted, based on who accepted the surrender and the difficulty
#   setting.  (This is meant to address a gameplay issue.  In the first 700
#   days or so, there is no possible benefit to surrendering rather than
#   fighting to the last man.)  Also, a bug that made it possible for
#   books etc. to be looted was corrected.
# - AI caravans take into consideration distance when choosing their next
#   destination and will be slightly more like to visit their own faction.
#   This strategy is mixed with the Native one, so the trade pattern will
#   differ but not wildly.
# - Scale town merchant gold by prosperity (up to a maximum 40% change).
# - Food prices increase in towns that have been under siege for at least
#   48 hours.
# - In towns the trade penalty script has been tweaked to make it more
#   efficient to sell goods to merchants specializing in them.
#
# Medium:
# - Food consumption increases in towns as prosperity increases.
#   Consumption also increases with garrison sizes.
# - Lords' looting skill affects how much gold they take from the player
#   when they defeat him.
# - Lords' leadership skill modifies their troop wage costs the same way
#   it does for the player.
# - The player can lose gold when his fiefs are looted, like lords.
# - The same way that lord party sizes increase as the player progresses,
#   mercenary party sizes also increase to maintain their relevance.
#   (The rate is the same as for lords: a 1.25% increase per level.)
# - If the player has a kingdom of his own, his spouse will receive
#   part of the bonus that ordinarily would be due a liege.  The extent
#   of this bonus depends on the number of fiefs the players holds.
#   This bonus is non-cumulative with the marshall bonus.
# - Attrition is inflicted on NPC-owned centers if they can't pay wages,
#   but only above a certain threshold.
# - Strangers cannot acquire enterprises (enforced at 1 instead of at 0,
#   so you have to do something).
#
# High:
# - The total amount of weekly bonus gold awarded to kings in Calradia
#   remains constant: as kings go into exile, their bonuses are divided
#   among the remaining kings.
# - If lord's run a personal gold surplus after party wages, the extra is
#   divided among the lord and his garrisons budgets (each castle and town
#   has its own pool of funds to pay for soldiers) on the basis of whether
#   the lord is low on gold or any of his fortresses are.  (If none are low
#   on gold, the lord takes everything, like before.)
# - The honor loss from an offense depends in part on the player's honor
#   at the time.  The purer the reputation, the greater the effect of a single
#   disagrace.
# - Raiding change: village gold lost is removed from uncollected taxes before
#   the balance (if any) is removed from the lord.
# - Csah for prisoners

# For relatives: a standard way of generating IDs for "relatives" that are not
# implemented in the game as troops, but nevertheless should be taken into
# account for the purpose of script_troop_get_family_relation_to_troop
