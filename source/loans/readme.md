### Loans

Each town contains a bank that the player can use to take loans.

Loans have an interest rate of 40% after the first 4 weeks, and 40% for every
2 weeks after the first 4.

Failing to pay in time penalises the player's relation with the town every 2 weeks.

The loans are capped to 100k, and once it reaches it, 
the relation with the king is also penalised every 2 weeks.
