## Patrols

* The maximum number of patrols equals the number of towns of the kingdom.
* Every 7 days a batch of patrols is created for each kingdom in order to compensate killed patrols.
* There are 3 types of patrols: small, medium and elite.
* patrols start in a town and patrols a specific region (nearby towns, castles or villages).
