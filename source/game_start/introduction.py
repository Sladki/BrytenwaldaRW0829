     "Englaland to the lands they conquered. The old isle has seen many "
     "conquerors and invaders, and for centuries the blood of warriors has "
     "fed the earth. First the Britons were here. Then the Romans came and "
     "they subdued the island they called Britannia. Some of the Britons "
     "became Roman themselves, and in the north the legions kept fighting the "
     "barbarians for many years. But one day, the empire fell and the legions "
     "withdrew from the island.^^What remained of Roman Britain was raided by "
     "Picts and Irishmen alike. The great wall built by the Romans from the "
     "sea of Ireland to the sea of Germany was no longer of any use, and their "
     "forts were deserted. The Britons, who had worshipped the God "
     "of the Christians were the prey of the barbarians and their internecine "
     "wars. To help them against their foes, they invited among them the fierce "
     "Saxons. But it was not long before they broke the alliance and rose against "
     "those who had welcomed them. For many years wars scorched the land, and "
     "strong leaders left their legacies: Emrys, Arthur, Urien in the north. "
     "Among them, Arthur had achieved the greatest success, slaughtering the "
     "Jutes and the Saxons at Mynydd Badon and forcing them into a lasting peace "
     "for 50 years.^^But the worst foes of the Britons were the Britons "
     "themselves, and their kings spent more time killing each other than "
     "fighting the invaders. This was enough for the Angles and Saxons to "
     "conquer more and more land in Britain, taking one realm after another.",

     "ground with anger and fire. Then came whole families, settlers of the new "

     "and language. This is the origin of what will become England.^^ By the "
     "7th century, the Anglo-Saxons ruled the eastern half of the island, and "
     "mighty kingdoms clashed together. The strongest king among the Angles "
     "and Saxons was known as Brytenwalda: Master of Britain. In year 636 AD, "
     "the title was held by Oswald, king of Bernicia, the northernmost kingdom "
     "of the Angles. The Britons of Gwynedd wanted to take revenge on him for "
